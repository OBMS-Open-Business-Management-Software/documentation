# Enterprise Agreement

## Introduction
Licensees whose Total Finances exceed €5 million are required to sign an enterprise agreement.

For information on the general licensing terms, refer to the [Software License](/misc/license) page.

## Enterprise Agreement Requirement
Under the Business Source License (BSL) 1.1, the software can be used freely in production environments. However, if a user's Total Finances exceed €5 million, an Enterprise Agreement is required to continue usage.

Total Finances is defined as the greater value of:

- The aggregate gross revenue of the entity using the software
- The total assets under management by the entity
